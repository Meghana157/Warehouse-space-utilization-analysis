# Warehouse-space-utilization-analysis

## Project Overview
The **Warehouse Space Utilization Analysis** project aims to evaluate how effectively warehouse space is being used. By analyzing the data related to warehouse inventory, the goal is to identify inefficiencies and provide actionable recommendations to optimize space utilization.

## Objectives
- Assess current space utilization in the warehouse.
- Identify patterns and trends in space usage over time.
- Provide actionable insights to improve warehouse efficiency and reduce costs.

## Dataset Description
The dataset for this project includes various details about products stored in a warehouse. It is used to calculate utilization rates and analyze the profitability of the stored items.

## Key Deliverables

### 1. Dashboard Creation
- Developed an interactive dashboard using Tableau to showcase metrics such as:
  - Utilization rates
  - Total costs
  - Revenues
  - Profits

### 2. Key Insights and Recommendations
- **Conclusions**:
  - Areas of inefficiency were identified by analyzing utilization rates across different sections (Refrigerated, Dry Goods, Perishables).
  - The **Cost to Profit Ratio** provided insights into product profitability.
- **Recommendations**:
  - Optimize storage of low-profit items to free up space for high-revenue products.
  - Adjust inventory strategies to reduce underutilization in specific sections.
  - Monitor seasonal trends to align stock levels with demand.

## Interactive Dashboard
Below is an example of the dashboard created during this project:

The dashboard visualizes:
- Total revenue by category
- Utilization rates by warehouse sections
- Cost to profit ratios
- Seasonality in utilization and revenue trends
- Cost and profit analysis by category

## Tools Used
- **Visualization**: Tableau

## Conclusion
This project provided an in-depth analysis of warehouse space utilization, offering actionable insights to enhance efficiency and profitability. The interactive dashboard enables stakeholders to make data-driven decisions for improved warehouse operations.
